By doing so, if the word is correct it will be marked with a distinctive color and you will be able to search for the next one.The palindromic words, that is, those that are read equally from right to left as from left to right, can be marked starting at either end.If you get stuck and you are not able to find any of the hidden words, you have a little help, since holding down a fixed cell will light up all the cells that have the same letter. You have three aids but if you need more you can get them by playing an advertisement.NOTE: Sometimes unexpected words are randomly generated; especially if they are very short (2 or 3 letters); on these occasions, if the word appears in the theme's dictionary, when it is tapped with your finger it will be added to the word list and will be tapped.COMPETITIONFor the bravest, a game mode has been incorporated in which you compete with another player who will search for the words on the same board.
